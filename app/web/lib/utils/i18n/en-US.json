So how do a good programmer like me teach its own kids programming? This is the problem I want to solve with our software and lessons. So I did a research by writing an autobiography of my programming life since age 7.",
      "openingWords3": "I have started programming since age 7, there are some key points in my own early experience, which I hope to bring to all kids around the world as if I was always by their sides.",
      "keyPoint1-part1": "In 1989 when I was 7, my father took me to his lab and gave me a book which I could not understand, but after I typed-in (copied) with keyboard like 20 lines of code from the book into the IBM PC, I saw a beautiful animated image born on screen. My father explained the meaning of some commands in language that I could almost understand. “Code is amazing!” and I realized in my little brain that I could do a lot more with it in future.",
      "coreContent1": "Core take away:",
      "keyPoint1-part2": "kids do not begin programming with writing or solving puzzles, they see and read first and imitate like a pro-programmer without the need to understand all the code they typed. This is how kids learn to speak their own native language: they see and read 100 times more than they write, this is true in native language class too.",
      "keyPoint2-part1": "A year later I got my own IBM PC at home. My father brought quite a few PC games first in floppy disks and later in a CD. In the following 3 years, I played-through and good at many (300+) games and learned DOS commands to install and run some big games and cheats. The game designer in late 1980s and early 1990s put really great brainpower in designing their games. I still believe games that kids play in 2010s are no match to those early games I mastered. I have been collecting good indi-games when I grew up, but as technology evolve, I have seen less and less good games each year (graphics are getting better; games are more addictive with levels and multi-player mode, most of today’s games keep users to make fast decisions than do a slow-thinking). To the year 1995 at age 12-13, I gradually stopped playing all games to the end, instead I had developed skills that I believed I could create 90% of the games that I played, and I spent lots of time writing and debugging my own games.",
      "coreContent2": "Core take away:",
      "keyPoint2-part2": "playing lots of good games is very important to let the kid know what they want to build themselves when they grow up with skills. Kids who only played a few games will not have any ideas of what project they want to build. Instead, kids needs to play as many games as possible and be really good at them, specially for boys.",
      "keyPoint3-part1": "In my early years, I played all games on IBM PC with a keyboard and later a mouse. Many of my peers played only on specialized game devices, they only became good gamers but never programmers, because they did not have keyboards and they did not manually install games with commands to make them run in 640KB memory like I did. BTW, my peers who played on Apple PC does not become programmers either. Although when my friend shows me the first notebook Mac, I think it is cool, but I still liked my 80386 running windows 3.1 then.",
      "coreContent3": "Core take away:",
      "keyPoint3-part2": "introduce kids to play on PC as early as possible. Teach them type with a keyboard and a mouse. Choose the right operating system (prefer Windows, MAC is fine today, but not back then)!",
      "keyPoint4-part1": "I used QuickBasic/C under DOS first, later Microsoft released their first IDE: version 1 of visual basic and c++, and I immediately switched to it, because the first version of Windows and the IDE can build graphical windows apps. Throughout my early years of programming, I grew up with their IDE. It is still today’s most popular IDE. However, elementary schools back then only teach QuickBasic in DOS, students in my school do not become young programmers like me.",
      "coreContent4": "Core take away:",
      "keyPoint4-part2": "kids should program with the right tool and language that enable them to program for the next 10 years rather than simple throw-away code that only simulate coding. Do not keep the kids switching IDE/apps, instead gradually give them tools that all work together, which can be used in professional domain.",
      "keyPoint5-part1": "Did I mention that I have a computer teacher that reviewed my code every weekend for 10 years, since I was 8? Yes, this is the most important part in my early project based learning. In my first 19 years, I lived in University campus of HIT (the one who built China’s first computer and robotics lab). And I had a computer teacher Mr LuYang who was 12 years older than me and also lived and studied in the same university campus. He is a computer genius to me.",
      "coreContent5": "Core take away: ",
      "keyPoint5-part2": " in project based learning, it is important that each kid has a mentor who is at least 12 years older than the kid but learned with the kids and help review the code and provide guidance. This teacher better to be a university student like in my case. Adults learn faster than kids and can provide essential help.",
      "keyPoint6-part1": "When Internet is not born, my bookshelf had all the computer books that I could buy. Microsoft released its windows NT preview API via MSDN subscription (two very thick books) between 1990 and 1992. My teacher got one and gave it to me after he finished reading it, he also recommended one or two other thick books to me too, of which I read over a hundred of times for some of its hard chapters. In the early days, I spent lots of time reading books, the printed API reference manual and the help pages of MSDN. I learned English mostly for reading these docs. I also remembered two books that magically appeared in my bookshelf, one contains 100 computer game design docs WITHOUT implementation but has some code hints; the other one contains 300 design doc of scientific home-made inventions. I implemented lots of them in software and in the physical world when I was 10-12 years old, later I was able to design my own games and spent more time in the software world. In 1995, we had Internet, web portals and CDROM all of a sudden, it opened a new world. In 1997, I finished one networked based game that I worked on since 1995, and later some games in 3D, and then I created my own website and open sourced all my 20 games on it. (In early days, I lost source code many times due to computer failures and cried). Since middle school, my projects are pretty big ones and school works were heavy, and I only released one or two projects per year, but I spent all my free time in programming.",
      "coreContent6": "Core take away:",
      "keyPoint6-part2": "how and from where kids obtain information is very important. The kids should soon move on to obtain information from the real world like the official dev site, search engines and books written by real masters for pro-programmers. Parents and teachers should provide guidance directing kids to those information source. They do not need to understand all of them, but in my experience, kids have the ability to figure them out and leave placeholders in their brain. This is true when a new baby is born to such a complex world and forced to live in it without enough knowledge, but all of them survive without a problem.",
      "keyPoint7-part1": "It is really lucky that I can grow with the developers of the tools I used and read all their change logs. I witnessed the complete evolution of windows and visual studio. I knew all the new functions, technologies, new languages, user interface changes between each of their releases since version 1. The users of Haqi witnessed the same 4 year evolution of paracraft, this is why many of our fans are old users since the initial release.",
      "coreContent7": "Core take away:",
      "keyPoint7-part2": "if one can not live with Socrates, we simulate it. This is why created lessons and written books and tutorials to simulate the evolution of great thoughts and complex software. Nowadays, kids have huge selection of big games and mature tools. Unlike my childhood, they can easily get lost and can not keep on a focused track of learning programming. We should prepare and create addictive lessons to keep the kids on the right track and grow with it for years. Just like they can play their most favorite one-game for years.",
      "conclusions": "Conclusions:",
      "conclusionsOpeningWords": "The lesson system in keepwork should match the core take aways from my own autobiography. And I found that the current school-based or self-paced programming-lesson solutions are far from optimum, and some can even bring the kids to the wrong path. Kids can learn a lot about programming if with proper guidance and support. By the age of 15, some of them can work like a pro-programmer, this should be our lesson goals.",

But students only solved puzzles so far and have no idea what unique project or story they like to create. Even they do have an idea, they are not ready with the skills to create them, or not sure what the kid-tools they learned is capable of, because they may have seen some peer projects, but never had the time in class to study their source code.

We will have lessons even for professionals. And we hope over 10% of all kids can reach to the professional level by the age of 15, if they started playing our lessons since age 7. In the 12 years of teaching (K12), we give them world-class games to play, world-class code to read, a set of programming tool chain that can all work together to create their own app and games. After paracraft/npl, they can learn other languages too, but in a professional way. We will have some lessons that introduce other professional languages and tools, but teaching them is out of our scope. They should have the ability to learn them in professional ways by then, like I have used over 20 languages during my professional life.",
