You are the spirit of rain, sprinkled spring girl's tears, fine and dense, such as flower needles, such as rain curtain, bit by bit, delicate and affectionate. You are holding oil paper umbrellas and whining and wandering in the rain. In the drizzle of spring, you are wearing purple cheongsam, twisting your waist, and walking towards it. The rain is like shuttle, smoke is like weave, you walk on high heels, gentle steps, accompanied by the wind, accompanied by rain, into the scenery of spring rain.",

It anesthetizes me and makes me stand back in the light of hope, unwilling to break the dream.",

The country road from my house to the yard, to the persimmon grove, to the apple orchard, and to the fields is the most familiar and most unforgettable. On this country road, I left my irregular footprints, leaving my youth.",

He despises some weakness and can't help but return to his pride.",

Berkeley was the oldest one at the University of California. It is also a founding member of the Association of American Universities. Its mascots have changed from the emblem of California, so their students often call themselves \"Golden Bears.\" The University of California, Berkeley, along with Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are honored as the academic leaders of engineering science and technology in the United States."
