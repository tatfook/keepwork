Berkeley was the oldest one at the University of California. It is also a founding member of the Association of American Universities. Its mascots have changed from the emblem of California, so their students often call themselves \"Golden Bears.\" The University of California, Berkeley, along with Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are honored as the academic leaders of engineering science and technology in the United States."
